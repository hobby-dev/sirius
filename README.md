# Sirius

This is a test project for a game company. There were three tasks:

* Write a function that prints signed integer as it's binary representation without using library functions (see [first.cpp](./src/first.cpp) for implementation)
* Remove consecutive character duplicates from a string (see [second.cpp](./src/second.cpp) for implementation)
* Serialize/deserialize a linked list (see [third.hpp](./src/third.hpp) for details)

## Prerequisites

* cmake
* clang
* bash

Tested on ```Ubuntu 18.10``` with ```clang 7.0.0-3``` and ```cmake 3.12.1```

## Usage

```bash
./build.sh
./build/bin/sirius
```
